# macomal

Mach-O application with backdoored dylib, compiled and obfuscated 
in Golang, where the flag is built as a Linked list and encoded per state

## Roadmap
 
* Replace `host` with working app image that's codesigned to
supported library injection
* Mixed boolean algebra for Linked list generation
* LLVM obfuscator with opaque predicates
