# CSAW-CTF-2021-Quals

See individual challenges for `README.md` files. Many have walkthroughs, everything has a solver. Individual authors are cited for external collaborators, everything else was done in house. We hope you enjoy the challenges! Also see our Discord server linked to from the Welcome challenge, we regret not being able to leave it open unmoderated but NYU policy as of 2021 was that we could not. Happy hacking! Best wishes, the OSIRIS Lab
