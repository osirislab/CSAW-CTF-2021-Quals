  "description": "Attached is a packet capture taken from a building management network. One of the analog sensors reported values way outside of its normal operating range. Can you determine the object name of this analog sensor? Flag Format: flag{{Name-of-sensor}}. For example if the object name of this analog sensor was \"Sensor_Temp1\", the flag would be flag{{Sensor_Temp1}}. (Note: because there are a limited number of sensors, we're only giving you two guesses for this challenge, so please check your input carefully.)\n\nAuthor: CISA",
