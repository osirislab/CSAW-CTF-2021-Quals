The House Of Life

    By Madison Julius Cawein


    They are the wise who look before,
    Nor fear to look behind;
    Who in the darkness still ignore
    Pale shadows of the mind.

    Who, having lost, though loss be much,
    Still dare to dream and do:
    For what was shattered at a touch
    It may be mended, too.

    The House of Life hath many a door
    That leads to many a room;
    And only they who look before
    Shall win beyond its gloom.

    Who stand and sigh and look behind,
    Regretful of past years,
    No room, of all those rooms, shall find
    That is not filled with fears.

    'T is better not to stop or stay;
    But set all fear aside,
    Fling wide the door, whate'er the way,
    And enter at a stride.

    Who dares, may win to his desire;
    Or, failing, reach the tower,
    Whereon Life lights the beacon-fire
    Of one immortal hour.
