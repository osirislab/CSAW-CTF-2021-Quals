    "description": "So it was just another day in Danville when Phineas and Ferb were making a new device to communicate with Meep as he travels across the galaxy. To make a device suitable for galatic communication and secure enough to be safe from alien hackers, they decide to protect their device with QKD! Unfortunately, due to Phineas & Co singing their usual musical numbers about their inventions, Doofenshmirtz has caught wind of this technology and wants to use it to take over the Tristate area, using his brand new Qubit-Disrupt-inator.\nNaturally I, Major Monogram, have to send you, Perry the Platypus, on a mission to stop Doofenshmirtz from disrupting Phineas and Ferb's qubits with his diabolical inator. So grab your tiny fedora and doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-ba-doo your way over to stop Doofenshmirtz!\nMission:\n- Receive # of qubits that translate to the flag\n- Measure qubits in your own basis\n- Monogram tells you how many qubits were measured correctly, but not which ones\n- Go back and fix it\n- Get it right\n",
